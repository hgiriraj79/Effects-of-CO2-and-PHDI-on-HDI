# Effect of CO2 and Planetary pressures-adjusted Human Development Index (PHDI) on Human Development Index (HDI)

- This project is created to analyse the effects of CO2 and PHDI on HDI.

### In this project I have made use of Linear Regression to observe the impact of CO2 and PHDI on HDI and perform a descriptive statistical analysis of the data present in the dataset. Lastly, I have performed a t.test to perform hypothesis testing to check if there is a difference in HDI between three decades.
